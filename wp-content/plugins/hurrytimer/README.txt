Create unlimited urgency and scarcity evergreen and recurring countdown timers for WordPress and WooCommerce to boost conversions and sales instantly.

== Description ==

[HurryTimer](https://hurrytimer.com/) is a multi-purpose countdown timer that allows you to create urgency and scarcity that drives clicks, increases sales, and highlights upcoming events or deadlines.

Use HurryTimer to create:

**Evergreen campaigns:**
Give each visitor their own unique countdown timer regardless of their local timezone and the moment they visited your site.

Recurring campaigns are self repeating countdown timers that run according to a set of rules. It's great way for telling customers about shipping cut-off times to get them to checkout faster.

**Fixed Deadline Campaigns:**
Run campaign between two fixed dates. No matter who visits your site the countdown timer is the same. It's a great way for event-based sales with a firm deadline.
